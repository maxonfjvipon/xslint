## Unreleased

- Add inline suppression directives — `xslint-disable-next-line`,
  `xslint-disable-line`, and `xslint-disable-file` (#262), and report a
  directive that suppresses nothing as unused (#288).
- **Breaking:** drop the `template-match-` prefix from every rule name and
  rationalize a few awkward ones, so `--suppress` strings and config `rules`
  keys change accordingly; add a conformance test that enforces rule naming,
  motives, and test packs (#258).
- Add a `.xslint.yml` configuration file — rule severities and globs,
  `exclude`, `max-warnings`, `log-level`, `quiet` — resolved with `--config`
  and walk-up discovery (#261, #282, #283, #284, #285).
- Add c8 coverage measurement with a 90% gate and a Codecov badge (#265).
- Add scheduled Stryker mutation testing (#266).
- Parse each XPath rule once at load instead of once per file (#256).
- Compute each tokenizer probe once per position (#255).
- Apply the schema-type and node-set rules to XSLT 3.0 stylesheets (#259).
- Make the exit code severity-aware and add `--max-warnings` (#264).
- Send logs to stderr and defects to stdout, and add `--quiet` (#263).
- Add round-trip and offset property tests for the tokenizer (#267).
- Point the README badges at this repository (#254).
